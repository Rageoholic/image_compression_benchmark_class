This was run on an ubuntu 22.10 droplet with gcc. You can build using `make` in the root 
directory of the project. You will need jpeglib installed and a C++17 compatible compiler.
Additionally we make use of some inline assembly so if you want to compile under MSVC 
you're going to need to find an equivalent for the escape function. This has only
been run against one set of files so it's possible there exists files that will
cause crashes. That said, it's all standard and I don't think there's any UB
so it should be fine.
